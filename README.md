**Create a REST version of the previous homework using express.js and typescript.**

**The API should be able to handle:**

- [x] Creating a blog post.

- [x] Updating a blog post

- [x] Deleting a blog post

- [x] Retrieving a single blog post based on an identifier

- [x] Retrieve a list of blog posts ordered from most recent to older.

- [x] PostgreSQL must be used as storage solution.

- [x] All post must be stored to database.

- [x] No authentications or security restrictions are needed.

- [x] Creating comments for posts.

- [x] Creating the ability to add tags to posts.

- [x] Apply at least 2 middleware.

- [x] Validate incoming data.

- [x] Handle Errors.

**Homework Part 2**

- [x] Provide a database entity relationship diagram of the database that you are using.

- [x] The ERD can be a link, picture, pdf or anything we can see at a detailed level.

**Extra Credit**

- [ ] Your program implements code migrations such that, having an empty database should be the only requirement. scripts are provided to seed and create all the tables needed.
