**The API should be able to handle:**

- [ ] Updating a blog post

- [ ] Deleting a blog post

- [ ] Retrieving a single blog post based on an identifier

- [ ] Retrieve a list of blog posts ordered from most recent to older.

- [ ] PostgreSQL must be used as storage solution.

- [ ] All post must be stored to database.

- [ ] No authentications or security restrictions are needed.

- [ ] Creating comments for posts.

- [ ] Creating the ability to add tags to posts.

- [ ] Apply at least 2 middleware.

- [ ] Validate incoming data.

- [ ] Handle Errors.

**Homework Part 2**

- [ ] Provide a database entity relationship diagram of the database that you are using.

- [ ] The ERD can be a link, picture, pdf or anything we can see at a detailed level.

**Extra Credit**

- [ ] Your program implements code migrations such that, having an empty database should be the only requirement. scripts are provided to seed and create all the tables needed.
